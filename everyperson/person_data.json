Yet in this doodle junkyard I notice people and I cannot help but see everyone and anything as at least a tiny bit special…",

Through the barely held thread of connection I got one clear message  - with a dull gesture they showed how my scarf should go on me.",

Consequently, any action taken by a single squirt is merely an \"embryonic\" squirt, existing in a dream-like state.\r\n\r\nSquirts do not dream, yet their actions are driven by a plan, with the distribution of their weight tied to the energy distribution to maximise their squirt. This utility function cannot be calculated in traditional terms; thus, squirts are essentially defined as irrational agents.\r\n\r\nI hope now you understand.\r\n",
